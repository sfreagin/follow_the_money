## Notes on Executive Compensation

Hello and welcome to this repository which documents the structure and nature of generally-accepted Executive Compensation practices. 

The motivation is to:
1. Educate the audience on **how and why executives are compensated** as they are
2. Explore the causal nature governing the many ways **incentives can and will motivate behavior**
3. Enumerate specific instances of **unintended consequences** that may arise from well-intentioned compensation practices
