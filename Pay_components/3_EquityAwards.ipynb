They give you the option *but not the obligation* to purchase shares at a predetermined exercise price. Stock options also often have a vesting schedule. Stock options have fallen out of favor with larger companies because of accounting changes, and also it's much harder to grow a large company than a small company percentage-wise."

    "Performance stock awards are designed similar to cash performance bonuses, with payout ranges based on achievement of predetermined metrics. The performance period and measurement period are typically longer, most often 3 years, and the payout is usually in shares a common stock (as opposed to cash). The most common metric is Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and most often measured on a *relative* basis, *i.e.* compared to the TSR performance of other companies in the peer group. Sometimes TSR is measured in absolute terms. I personally do not care for the use of TSR as a metric to incentivize executives over the long term, because it takes the focus away from company execution and places it on stock price.\n",
